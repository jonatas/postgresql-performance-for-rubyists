# Notes and learnings

Here's a list of notes and learnings from the workshop.

## üìä ORM Comparison (ActiveRecord vs Sequel)

This example demonstrates performance differences between ActiveRecord and Sequel across various operations:

1. **Simple Query Performance**
   - Sequel's `where` clause is dramatically faster (10,178.6 i/s vs 82.6 i/s)
   - For simple `all` queries, both ORMs perform similarly

2. **Complex Join Performance**
   - Sequel outperforms ActiveRecord by 3.25x for complex joins
   - Sequel: 93.3 i/s
   - ActiveRecord: 28.7 i/s

3. **Aggregation Performance**
   - ActiveRecord performs better for aggregations (1.34x faster)
   - ActiveRecord: 220.2 i/s
   - Sequel: 164.0 i/s

4. **Bulk Operation Performance**
   - Sequel is 1.26x faster for bulk inserts
   - Sequel: 272.6 i/s
   - ActiveRecord: 215.7 i/s

5. **Query Building Performance**
   - Sequel's method chaining is 1.30x faster
   - Sequel: 162.2 i/s
   - ActiveRecord: 124.6 i/s

## üîß Troubleshooting Guide

Common issues you might encounter during the workshop and how to solve them:

### Storage Section Issues

```ruby
# Issue: TOAST values not visible in regular queries
# Solution: Use the following to see TOAST-ed values:
ActiveRecord::Base.connection.execute("""
  SELECT *, pg_column_size(large_field) as field_size 
  FROM my_table WHERE id = 1
""").first
```

### Transaction Issues

```ruby
# Issue: Deadlock detected
# Solution: Order your operations consistently
def safe_transfer(from_account, to_account, amount)
  # Always lock accounts in the same order
  Account.transaction do
    [from_account, to_account].sort_by(&:id).each(&:lock!)
    # Perform transfer operations
  end
end
```

### Query Performance Issues

```ruby
# Issue: Slow LIKE queries
# Solution: Use trigram indexes for pattern matching
class AddTrigramIndexToUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]
  def up
    execute "CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_trgm"
    add_index :users, :name, using: :gin, opclass: :gin_trgm_ops
  end
end

# Now your LIKE queries will use the index
User.where("name LIKE ?", "%john%")
```

### TimescaleDB tips

In case you get locked while inserting data into a hypertable, you can use the following code to insert data in batches by hour.

Avoid inserting data in unsorted batches, as it will create a new chunk dynamically. Instead, sort the data by time first. Grouping by time will create a new chunk for each batch, and two processes will compete to create new chunks, locking the table.


```ruby
# Issue: Slow inserts with many chunks, returning all the data at once
Metric.insert_all(metrics_data) # bad 

# Solution: Use bulk inserts with appropriate time batching
metrics_data.group_by { |m| m[:time].beginning_of_hour }
  .each{ |_, batch| Metric.insert_all!( batch, returning: false )} # good
```

#### Why is this happening?

> The problem is that the insert is happening over multiple chunks, and two process are competing to create new chunks. Grouping by hour makes sure no batches overlap with each other, reducing the time the transaction is locked.

## üîç Performance Comparison Tables

### Query Types Performance (ops/sec)

| Operation Type | ActiveRecord | Sequel | Raw SQL | Notes |
|---------------|--------------|--------|---------|-------|

## üåç Real-World Scenarios

Here are common real-world scenarios you might encounter and how to handle them efficiently:

### 1. High-Traffic Blog Platform

```ruby
# Challenge: Handling high-volume read operations
class Article < ApplicationRecord
  # Use counter cache for comments count
  has_many :comments, counter_cache: true
  
  # Use materialized view for trending articles
  def self.trending
    Scenic.database.refresh_materialized_view(
      :trending_articles, concurrently: true
    )
    TrendingArticle.all
  end
  
  # Cache expensive computations
  def related_articles
    Rails.cache.fetch([self, "related", updated_at]) do
      Article.where(category: category)
             .where.not(id: id)
             .limit(5)
    end
  end
end
```

### 2. E-commerce Order Processing

```ruby
# Challenge: Handling concurrent order processing
class Order < ApplicationRecord
  include OrderStateMachine
  
  def self.process_batch(orders)
    # Use advisory locks to prevent duplicate processing
    orders.each do |order|
      with_advisory_lock("order_#{order.id}") do
        transaction(isolation: :repeatable_read) do
          order.process!
          order.update_inventory
          order.notify_customer
        end
      end
    end
  end
  
  # Use partial indexes for common queries
  def self.pending_shipment
    where("shipped_at IS NULL AND status = 'paid'")
  end
end
```

## üìä Real-time Analytics with TimescaleDB

```ruby
# Issue: TOAST values not visible in regular queries
# Solution: Use the following to see TOAST-ed values:
ActiveRecord::Base.connection.execute("""
  SELECT *, pg_column_size(large_field) as field_size
  FROM my_table WHERE id = 1
""").first
```
TimescaleDB extends PostgreSQL with powerful time-series capabilities. Here's how to implement efficient real-time analytics:

### 1. Setting Up Time-Series Tables

 ```ruby
class Measurement < ActiveRecord::Base
  extend Timescaledb::ActsAsHypertable

  acts_as_hypertable time_column: 'time',
    segment_by: 'device_id',
    value_column: 'temperature',
    chunk_time_interval: '1 day'

  scope :avg_temperature, -> { select('device_id, avg(temperature) as temperature').group('device_id') }
  scope :avg_humidity, -> { select('device_id, avg(humidity) as humidity').group('device_id') }
  scope :battery_stats, -> { select('device_id, min(battery_level) as min_battery, avg(battery_level) as battery_level').group('device_id') }
 end
 ```

### 2. Continuous Aggregates for Real-time Analytics

You can use the `continuous_aggregates` helper to create continuous aggregates hierarchies using declared scopes.

 ```ruby
continuous_aggregates scopes: [:avg_temperature, :avg_humidity, :battery_stats],
  timeframes: [:hour, :day],
  refresh_policy: {
    hour: {
      start_offset: '3 hours',
      end_offset: '1 hour',
      schedule_interval: '1 hour'
    },
    day: {
      start_offset: '3 days',
      end_offset: '1 day',
      schedule_interval: '1 day'
    }
}
```

### 3. Query data for the Real-time Analytics Dashboard

Query from raw data and mix scopes to filter out the data you need:

```ruby
Measurement.today.avg_temperature # average temperature per device
Measurement.last_hour.avg_humidity # average humidity per device
Measurement.last_minute.battery_stats # min and avg battery level per device
```

Using the macro in the model, you can query the continuous aggregate directly from generated class:

```ruby
Measurement::AvgTemperatureByHour.today.all
Measurement::AvgTemperatureByDay.last_week.all
```

### 4. Multi-tenant SaaS Application

```ruby
# Challenge: Isolating tenant data and optimizing queries
class ApplicationRecord < ActiveRecord::Base
  def self.tenant_scope(tenant_id)
    # Use PostgreSQL Row Level Security
    where(tenant_id: tenant_id)
  end
  
  # Use partial indexes for each tenant
  def self.create_tenant_index(tenant_id)
    execute("""
      CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY index_#{table_name}_tenant_#{tenant_id}
      ON #{table_name} (created_at)
      WHERE tenant_id = #{tenant_id}
    """)
  end
end
```

### 5. Background Job Processing

```ruby
# Challenge: Efficient batch processing
class BatchProcessor
  def self.process_large_dataset
    # Use cursor-based pagination
    User.find_each(batch_size: 1000) do |user|
      # Use bulk operations
      updates = user.pending_notifications.map do |notification|
        { id: notification.id, status: 'processed' }
      end
      
      Notification.upsert_all(
        updates,
        unique_by: :id,
        returning: false
      )
    end
  end
end
```
